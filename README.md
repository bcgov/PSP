# PIMS

Property Information Management System

## Introduction

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure's (MoTI's) Regional property services offices and Headquarter’s Properties and Land Management Branch (PLMB) are the two units responsible for Ministry property-related business and will be the major users of the system. Property Services manages all major fee simple and highway acquisition and property-related operational functions such as valuation, acquisition, expropriation, compensation entitlements, highway closure, and disposition.

PLMB are responsible for the corporate functions of the property acquisition program, such as creating acquisition policy, standards, procedures and tools; managing the Expropriation and Litigation program; managing tenure issues and the stewardship of Ministry/BCTFA property records. It is also responsible for property management and disposition of its surplus property, including: managing the ministry's province-wide leasing/licensing/rental program and BCTFA fee-simple property assets as well as disposition of stand-alone surplus property.

## Problem Statement

The information management for MoTI's property services business processes is distributed between multiple systems, and many of those systems are technologically and functionally inadequate to support the Ministry's needs to consolidate relevant property data to enable operational and strategic decision making.

## Hypothesis

If we have a modern easy to use system built in collaboration with, and for the benefit of, clients they will have a means to collect, consolidate and reference property related data for the entire lifecycle of the property. This will then support real time operational and executive decision making.

## Goal

The purpose of the Properties Services Project is to implement a new solution that will record, track and manage
information about all property interests of MOTI/BCTFA and enable efficient operation of the Ministry's associated
property business processes.

The objectives include:

- Record and process information about all Property interests of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTI) and assets held by the Ministry and BC Transportation Financing Authority (BCTFA).
- Produce reports and standard Ministry forms related to property business.
- Spatially display the current legal Provincial cadastre and associate to all MoTI property interests’ data and documentation.
- Display associations from properties of interest to current and historical property data, property activities, property interests, and supporting documentation.
- Enable the Ministry to record and retrieve accurate, complete, and permanently accessible information about the acquisition, management and disposition of transportation related property.
