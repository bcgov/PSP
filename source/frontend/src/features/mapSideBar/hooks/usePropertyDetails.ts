   * This effect is intended to run AFTER the property info has been loaded from the API.
   * This is guaranteed here because:
   *   1. location is a memo that only gets re-calculated when the property info comes back
   *      from the API with proper lat, long values. So until API results comes back it will be undefined.
   *
   *   2. The useEffect below aborts early if location is undefined so it won't call the layers until
   *      a location is available (because that is needed to query the layers). So effectively if the API
   *      takes longer to return then the second effect will return early and re-run whenever the API
   *      response is set via setState on propertyDetails
